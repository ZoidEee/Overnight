# Overnight.Fi Datascrape

This project was designed to pull the payout data from the website of Overnight.finance. With little modification to the underlying code you can swap
the network to what is currently offered (5 as of writing) as well as change the filename. 

Need to work on:
- unknown but needs to possibly be ran 3-5 times to work correctly; may not find data rerun till it will locate
- Doesn't load AVA Data


Adjust line 5 of xlsx.py to the correct directory
